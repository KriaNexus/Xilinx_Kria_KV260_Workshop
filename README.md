<img src="/images/placeholder-1-e1533569576673.png" width=100 height =100>

This repository is designed to set up the KV260 Starter kit board and then run Accelerated Applications (AA) on the SOM board. Working through each section will help you learn how to integrate Xilinx carrier card with some AI and Smart Camera applications. You can take what you've learned here to your own projects and applications. 

The KV 260 incorporates a Zynq® UltraScale+™ MPSoC, run-time memory, non-volatile boot devices, integrated power solution, and security module. The vision-focused SOM carrier card includes various application peripheral options such as camera, sensor inputs, video display outputs, USB, SD card, and Ethernet interfaces.

## Part 1: Setup Board
