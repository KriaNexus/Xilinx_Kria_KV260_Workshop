A list of accelerated applications that can be explored on the SOM board. This table below is from UG 1089.

| Name  | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| AA1: Smart camera  | Configurable camera/sensor input options with hardware accelerated ML inference with face detection and other models that can be dynamically loaded. Inference information is outputted to a monitor or network via RTSP. |
| AA2: AI box  | Multi-stream IP camera RTSP inputs with hardware accelerated ML inference models supporting face detection and re-identification (ReID) models. Outputs are displayed to monitor  |
|AA4: Defect detection | Hardware accelerated machine vision application as applied in defect detection.|
|AA5: License plate recognition | Third party accelerated application for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR). |
