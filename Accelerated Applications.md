A list of accelerated applications that can be explored on the SOM board. This table below is from UG 1089.

| Name  | Description | Additional Features|
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| AA1: Smart camera  | Configurable camera/sensor input options with hardware accelerated ML inference with face detection and other models that can be dynamically loaded. Inference information is outputted to a monitor or network via RTSP. | [Additional features for AA1](https://github.com/Xilinx/Xilinx_KV260_Workshop/blob/main/Additional%20AA1%20Features.md)|
| AA2: AI box  | Multi-stream IP camera RTSP inputs with hardware accelerated ML inference models supporting face detection and re-identification (ReID) models. Outputs are displayed to monitor  |[Additional features for AA2](https://github.com/Xilinx/Xilinx_KV260_Workshop/blob/main/Additional%20AA2%20Features.md)|
|AA4: Defect detection | Hardware accelerated machine vision application as applied in defect detection.|Additional features for AA4|
|AA5: License plate recognition | Third party accelerated application for automatic license plate recognition (ALPR). | Additional features for AA5|
