# Part 4: Optional Demo

Depending on time, you may complete this demo at home. 

As you have seen that there are three AI models provided here via â€“aitask command line option; facedetect (densebox_320_320), refinedet (refinedet_pruned_0_96), ssd (ssd_adas_pruned_0_95) etc. But the customization can be made to use other Vitis AI models of the same class or use the retrained models by the users.
